ZhouHai Project:

1. Convert ZhouHai Watchface tool from windows to web-based tool.
2. We now have a frontend, on clicking the 'generate bin' button, a watchFace.json file of a very particular pattern is generated. This json file
is sent to the backend for bin generation. At the backend we have a ZhouHai bin generator, which essentially converts our json file into a bin file.


Main Project:

Like ZhouHai, we have many vendors.

Not all vendors use a json file to generate bin file, some use json, some use folders to divide components.
Therefore, The backend bin file generator of each type expects different things. The ZhouHai project bin generator expects the json file, 
The the JieLi bin generator expects folder in the exact pattern (as in the example).

But we cannot sit and make frontend for each vendor, so we use the json file as a bridge.
We have already built a frontend that generates the watchFace.json json file, for JieLi, we will basically make a middleware that converts
this json file into the exact pattern of folders required by the Jieli bin generator. The bin generator will use these folders to generate
the bin file which the user can download on the frontend and push to the watch.

Your current task is: Make a middleware to convert the json file into folders for Jieli, send those folders to the JieLi backend bin generator
and get the bin file.
